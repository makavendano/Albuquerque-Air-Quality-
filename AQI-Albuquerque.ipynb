    "As an explorer in the world of data analytics, this project is a way to showcase data cleaning and exploration with MySQL and data visualization with PowerBI.

Livability relies heavily on the quality of air within certain areas and contributes to healthy communities. Air pollution can lead to heart attacks, heart disease, and lung cancer among other diseases. On the contrary, healthy air prevents heart attacks, lung cancer, and both acute and severe asthma."

    "This data set includes daily air quality index (AQI) values recording from different sites throughout Albuquerque, NM and the surrounding areas. This dataset was found while researching environmental data sets through our local governments database. The dataset is divided up yearly into air quality index (AQI) values that were recorded daily. We are looking at 6 main air pollutants: ground – level ozone (O3 or Ozone), particle pollution (divided into 2 pollutants PM10 and PM2.5), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 8 different sites within Albuquerque, New Mexico and it’s surrounding areas. The overall AQI recording is read based on the parameters in the photo below (figure 1). "
